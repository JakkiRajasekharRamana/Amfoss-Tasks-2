1)
The major advantage of a function is to group code that gets executed multiple times basically a long code which repeats itself can be chaniged into few lines of code by using funtions
2)
A function excutes only if the function is called ,once a function is defined we can execute it by calling it
3)
A function can be created by using the def statement
4)
A defined function usually contains a code which can can be exicuted everytime the function is called,funtion call is defined to call functions where as funtion is defined to a certain code.
5)
There will be only one global scope and will be created once the program begins and will destroyed once the program ends.
one can have more than one local scope it depends on how many times a funtion will be called,each time a funtion is called = local scope(s) present.
6)
Once the funtion returns, the local scope will be destroyed and so will the variables present will be forgotten.
7)
A value that a funtion call evaluates to is called as the return value of the function.
Yes a return value can be part of a expression, the return value is what a expression evalutes to.
8)
Python will add return none to the end of any funtion without showing no return statement.
9)
when we declare a value for a variable which is not inside a function python assumes it as its global variable
10)
The datatype of None value is the only value of the NoneType data type.
11)
It will import the value of 'areallyourpetsnamederic' into a given set of function or wherever the user wants to import the data to.

bacon()
13)
We can prevent a crash by simply writing a try-except statement we can also use the statement sys.exit().
14)
Try and except clause(s) are used if an error occours ,the code which is likely to have a error will be be put in a try clause if the error happends the program execution move's to the start of a except clause which can contain a code which will be executed, then the execution will continue as normal.
